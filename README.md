## Business Problem
In parts of rural India, the diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopthy (DR) can be a difficult undertaking. Equipment is large and bulky, and people have no means of traveling to clinics to be tested for DR. If caught early enough, there are options available to mitigate patients' suffering in the long term. The oDocs Fundus Adapter is a 3-D printed accessory that holds a 20 diopter lens which fits over a smart phone's camera. It makes capturing images of the retina in remote locations easy and affordable. The retinal image can be entered into our app and a diagnosis returned to the operator. This will increase the number of patients that can be reached and cut down on time between image capture, diagnosis and treatment. 

## Data
The Data are a combination of 3 datasets. The first, and the genesis for the idea, comes from the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection on Kaggle . Secondly, data was sourced from INDIAN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IMAGE DATASET (IDRID)
